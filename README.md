# Fragile State Index Analysis

The aim of the study is to apply different classifier to the dataset obtained from the Fragile State Index data and compare their precision in correctly classifying the countries. Additionally, to increase the precision of classification 6 additional indicator are needed to be collected and merged into the existing data. This addition helps in improving classifier modelsâ€™ accuracy. Lastly action rules are to be extracted from the data to help identify key indicators for the countries the are in the Alert category that will assist in transitioning these countries into a much safer category. Software packages like **WEKA, LISP Miner** are used to classifier/discretize/mine the datasets.
